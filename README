--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sfCombinePlus is a fork of sfCombine written by Alexandre Mogère and
François Zaninotto. See: http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfCombinePlugin

The purpose of this plugin is to provide the means to auto minify and cache
Javascript and CSS files that are used in your web application. The aim of this
plugin is to provide the flexibility that can be achieved without using such a
utility with the performance boost that can be achieved by using a auto
minifying utility.

This fork changes the following things in sfCombine. Please read:
http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfCombinePlugin/1_1_0?tab=plugin_readme
- Javascript and CSS can be put into assigned groups to load particular groups
  of files in seperate script loading. This is so that global scripts can be on
  each page and extra javascripts can be in their own group which will allow
  global files to be cached by the client.
- Different groups can be output in different places, so all but one group
  could be output in the head and that last group just before the body
- Database usage is no longer required, files can be accessed by a base64 name
  or a human readable file string
- Allows limited parsing of php javascript/css files via a include, can have
  a query string.
- Handles external urls
- Works with the symfony option system for assets
- CSS files now have relative URL's altered to the new combined path
- Moves CSS @charset and @import declarations to the top of a combined file for
  correct syntax
- Only doctrine is supported when database is used
